START_WELCOME = """Welcome to your ultimate Recovery & Growth Tracker! 💪

I’m here to help you optimize your training by ensuring you never overtrain a sore muscle or neglect a rested one. I track the 72-hour recovery window for every muscle group so you can focus on hitting your PRs.
🛠 Quick Start Commands
/show_my_muscles – The "Dashboard." See exactly which muscles are Ready, Recovering, or Trained. Use the interactive buttons to log a workout instantly.

/add_muscle – Allows you to add muscle for tracking

/remove_muscle – Removes muscle from tracking(YOu dont have to enter full muscle name, just click once!)

/settings – Customize your recovery window (default is 72h) or change your notification preferences.(Work in progress)

💡 How it works:
Tap /show_my_muscles.

Select the muscle group you just crushed.

The bot marks it as Trained and starts a 72-hour countdown.

Once the time is up, the muscle will automatically move back to Ready.

Pro Tip: Consistency beats intensity. Keep your dashboard "green" by hitting the muscles that have finished their recovery cycle!
